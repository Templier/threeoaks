The .NET Interop docklet allows you to use .NET docklets with ObjectDock.

This is the SDK part. It contains three samples. See the Documentation and the Howto to get started.

The NetDockletHelper.dll file in SDK/ is a debug build, do not distribute it with your docklet.

The runtime part is available here: http://julien.wincustomize.com/viewskin.aspx?skinid=6013&libid=29
