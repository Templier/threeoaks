Valentine Dream
(C) 2008, Julien Templier
***************************************************************************

This is a special dynamic Dream for Valentine's Day. It shows animated
particles forming a heart.

You can tweak the color, size and texture of the particles in the Dream
configuration window. You can also choose amongst five different backgrounds
(and decide if you want to blur and/or colorize them).

** Troubleshoot
***************************************************************************

Log File
--------

Go to "%ProgramData%\Stardock\DeskScapes\ExtractedData". There should be a
folder named "Valentine {...}" with a file named "Valentine.log".
If it contains lines with "[ERROR]", something is not working correctly.

Go to this page (http://www.wincustomize.com/articles.aspx?aid=174456) and
post you info.

Crash
-----

In the case of a crash, Explorer might restart and crash in a loop.
If that happens, press CTRL-ALT-SUPPR, click on TaskManager.
Then select File->New Task and run regedit.exe

Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Stardock\Deskscapes, double-click on
"Plugin" and remove the value.

Explorer should now restart correctly.
