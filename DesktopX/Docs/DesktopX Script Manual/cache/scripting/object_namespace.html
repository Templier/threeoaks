<h1>Object namespace</h1>
<p>This section defines the scripting commands that can be applied to objects in 
DesktopX.</p>
<h2>Object.States namespace</h2>
<p>From the object namespace you can access the States namespace to read/write 
state specific properties. States properties also exist in the Object namespace. 
There are basically three different methods you can use to read/write:<br>
Object.property – it’ll read/write the state property for the current state<br>
Object.States(“mystate1”).property - it’ll read/write the state property for the 
“mystate1” state<br>
Object.States(“”).property – it’ll write the property to all states in the 
object<br>
<br>
Unless the object has only one state, it is usually better to use the second 
method.<br>
<br>
All properties which can be applied in the States namespace as well as in the 
Object namespace are suffixed with *<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Object.Name<br>
Object.Parent<br>
Object.Visible</h2>
<p>Through use of these commands you can set an objects name, though it is more 
likely you will want to retrieve the name of an object or its parent. 
Object.Parent is used to retrieve the entire object model of the parent, so you 
can refer to the object. In addition to this, you can also set an object’s 
parent using this property.<br>
The 'Visible' property is most useful allowing you to show or hide an object 
without the use of popups or messaging.<br>
Examples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="code">1) MsgBox &quot;This object is called &quot; &amp; Object.Name<br>
2) Msgbox &quot;This object's parent is &quot; &amp; Object.Parent.Object.Name<br>
3) Object.Parent = DesktopX.Object(&quot;Some object&quot;)<br>
4) DesktopX.Object(&quot;AnObject&quot;).Parent = DesktopX.ScriptObject(&quot;anotherobject&quot;)<br>
5) Object.Visible = False</p>
<h2>Object.Clone<br>
Object.Delete</h2>
<p>This allows you to either duplicate or delete the specified object. When 
duplicating an object you need to provide the name for the new object and the x 
and y coordinates where it will be placed. Deleting objects may be useful for 
things like deleting temporary objects such as instructions once the user has 
taken note of them.<br>
<br>
Examples:</p>
<p class="code">Object.Clone &quot;myobject&quot;, 300, 200<br>
If Msgbox(&quot;Delete object&quot;, vbYesNo) = vbYes Then Object.Delete</p>
<h2>Object.Top, Object.Bottom, Object.Left, Object.Right, Object.Move, 
Object.Rotation (and Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).Rotation)</h2>
<p>With these positioning properties, you can explicitly set or retrieve the 
location of one side of the object.<br>
If you want to reposition an object, the most efficient was to do it is via 
'Move' To do this you specify x and y coordinates in pixels of where you want to 
place the object.<br>
You can also rotate an object using Object.Rotation. <br>
<br>
Examples:</p>
<p class="code">Object.Top = 500<br>
Object.Move 500,200<br>
<br>
For x = 1 To 10<br>
Object.Rotation = x*36<br>
Object.Sleep 200<br>
Next</p>
<h2>Object.Height, Object.Width</h2>
<p>With this command you can retrieve or redefine the actual height and width of 
the object. Obviously this will stretch the graphic used until it reaches this 
size.<br>
<br>
Examples:</p>
<p class="code">Object.Height = 120<br>
Object.Width = Object.Width * 2</p>
<h2>Object.Resize</h2>
<p>With this command you can quickly and easily resize an object in one command 
rather than setting width and height individually.<br>
<br>
Examples:</p>
<p class="code">Object.Resize 100,300<br>
Object.Resize Object.Width + 10, Object.Height + 10</p>
<h2>Object.Hue, Object.Brightness, Object.Contrast, Object.Opacity<br>
also Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).Hue, Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).Brightness, <br/>Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).Contrast, Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).Opacity)</h2>
<p>If you want to dynamically change the color, hue or brightness of an object, 
it is easy to do with these commands. Simply set a value of 1-255 for hue, -255 
– 255 for brightness and -100 – 100 for contrast. Set it to 0 to remove any 
previously made changes.<br>
You can also set or retrieve the level of opacity that an object has in a range 
from 0 (totally invisible) to 100 (totally visible).<br>
Examples:</p>
<p class="code">For x = 0 To 255<br>
Object.Hue = x<br>
Next </p>
<p class="code">Object.Brightness = -30</p>
<p class="code">DesktopX.Object(&quot;anotherobject&quot;).Contrast = 40</p>
<p class="code">Object.Opacity = 60</p>
<h2>Object.State, Object.StatePreempt</h2>
<p>Through use of Object.State you can change or retrieve the state of an 
object. This is one of the most common commands used in script as it is used to 
trigger objects to act certain ways. Object.StatePreempt should be used when you 
want to set a state immediately without waiting for any animations etc to 
complete.<br>
Examples:</p>
<p class="code">If Object.State = &quot;Command executed&quot; Then ...</p>
<p class="code">x = DesktopX.Object(&quot;anotherobject).State</p>
<p class="code">DesktopX.ScriptObject(&quot;scr_object).Object.StatePreempt = &quot;Hide&quot; </p>
<h2>Object.Text, Object.TextColor, Object.TextBorder, Object.TextBorderColor<br>
also Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).Text, Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).TextColor, Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).TextBorder, 
Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).TextBorderColor</h2>
<p>If your object is a text object rather than an image, you can manipulate it 
using script changing either the text itself or the appearance. You can 
set/retrieve the text or it's color and well as defining whether the text has a 
border, and if so what color it is.<br>
The colors are most easily set using an RGB value separated via commas.<br>
Examples:</p>
<p class="code">If Instr(Object.Text, &quot;Data&quot;) Then Msgbox &quot;String found&quot;</p>
<p class="code">Object.TextColor = RGB(120,200,255)</p>
<p class="code">Object.TextBorder = True</p>
<p class="code">Object.TextBorderColor = RGB(255,0,0)</p>
<h2>Object.SetTimer, Object.KillTimer, Object.Sleep</h2>
<p>As discussed earlier, the Object.SetTimer sets an event and an interval to 
which you can then add code to run at the predefined interval. If you need to 
stop a timer running you can use KillTimer to stop it. e.g. Object.KillTimer 
12345 will stop any code in the Object_OnTimer12345 event from running.<br>
Object.Sleep stops code running temporarily for a defined period of time. For 
example Object.Sleep 1000 will wait for 1 second before continuing to run.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnScriptEnter<br>
&nbsp;
Object.SetTimer 12345, 600000<br>
End Sub<br>
<br>
Sub Object_OnTimer12345<br>
&nbsp;
MsgBox &quot;The time is &quot; &amp; Time()<br>
End Sub<br>
<br>
Sub Object_OnScriptExit<br>
&nbsp;
Object.KillTimer 12345<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Object.ExecuteCommand</h2>
<p>This executed any command associated with the object in it’s Object Type. 
This is particularly useful for doing things at set intervals or events, such as 
when DesktopX exits.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnScriptExit<br>
Object.ExecuteCommand<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Object.LocalStorage, Object.PersistStorage</h2>
<p>When coding it is often useful to store persistent information which can be 
retrieved and used as required across multiple executions of the same object or 
widget.<br>
To store data you need to give the data a unique reference (for that object) and 
set it's value. For example Object.LocalStorage(&quot;MyZip&quot;) = 48152 would place the 
value 48152 in a storage variable called MyZip. &quot;MyZip&quot;=48152 will be 
automatically saved and restored when the object is unloaded and reloaded.<br>
The difference between the two types is in its persistence across object 
packaging and distribution. LocalStorage will NOT be saved when the object is 
saved as .dxpack or a widget is built. PersistStorage instead will save its 
value.<br>
LocalStorage is useful to store personal information, like a passwork or a ZIP 
code. Infact, you don’t want such information to be preserved when you export 
and redistribute the object to other people. However, you want these values to 
be preserved across multiple run of the same object/widget.<br>
<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnScriptEnter<br>
&nbsp;
If Object.LocalStorage(&quot;MyZip&quot;) = &quot;&quot; Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Object.LocalStorage(&quot;MyZip&quot;) = &quot;48152&quot;<br>
&nbsp;
End If<br>
&nbsp;
Object.SetTimer12346, 3600000 <br>
End Sub<br>
<br>
Sub Object_OnTimer12346<br>
&nbsp;
GetWeather(Object.LocalStorage(&quot;MyZip&quot;))<br>
End Sub<br>
<br>
Sub Object_OnScriptExit<br>
&nbsp;
Object.KillTimer 12346<br>
End Sub<br>
<br>
Function GetWeather(zip)<br>
&nbsp;
...<br>
End Function </p>
<h2>Object.OnTop</h2>
<p>The object pushes an object to the top of the z-order which obviously makes 
it more visible. The below example makes an object appear above other objects 
when you move the mouse over it.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnStateChange(state)<br>
&nbsp;
If state = &quot;Mouse over&quot; Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Object.OnTop<br>
&nbsp;
End If<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Object.SetFocus</h2>
<p>The simply sets an objects focus so it can respond to events. For example all 
objects have an Object_OnSetFocus so this will be triggered if this command is 
used. Also, where a text based DesktopX object responds to functions based on 
keyboard or mouse activity (e.g. Function Object_OnChar(dwKeyCode, flag), 
Function Object_OnLButtonDown(x, y)) then it will respond when these events 
occur. You can also apply this to ActiveX controls, so for example if an object 
contains a DesktopX Edit Control then setting its focus will prepare it to 
accept text input.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnStateChange(state)<br>
&nbsp;
If state = &quot;Command executed&quot; Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Msgbox &quot;Ready for input&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Object.SetFocus<br>
&nbsp;
End If<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Object.TooltipText</h2>
<p>This allows you to set the tooltip of the object which is particularly useful 
to provide additional information to the user. You can also use this to provide 
different information depending on different circumstances.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">If Object.Text = &quot;New mail&quot; Then<br>
&nbsp;
Object.TooltipText = &quot;Click to launch mail software&quot;<br>
Else<br>
&nbsp;
Object.TooltipText = &quot; &quot;<br>
End If</p>
<h2>Object.AppBar</h2>
<p>An AppBar is an object that is designed to be attached to the edge of the 
screen like the Taskbar. Also like the taskbar it can be set to autohide, but 
beyond this you can undock it as well so it can be moved on the screen. When an 
appbar is set to Autohide, then moving the mouse over the edge of the screen 
will cause the AppBar to smoothly appear.<br>
Note that Object.AppBar can only be written, not read, so if you need to check 
the mode at any time you need to set a variable when you set the mode, and then 
query the value of this variable. Example 1 shows how you may set a variable in 
this manner.<br>
The values for Object.AppBar are as follows:<br>
0 = Disabled<br>
1 = Docked<br>
2 - Autohide<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnScriptEnter<br>
&nbsp;
Object.AppbarMode = 1<br>
&nbsp;
appmode = 1<br>
End Sub</p>
<p class="code">If state = &quot;Command executed&quot; Then<br>
&nbsp;
DesktopX.Object(&quot;maindock&quot;).AppbarMode = 2<br>
End If</p>
<h2>Object.Directory</h2>
<p>This tells you the directory within which the object is located. This will 
point to the user’s theme directory.</p>
<h2>Object.Sound *</h2>
<p>This allows you to set the sound associated with the object either globally 
or specific to certain states. The sound file targeted can either be a WAV or 
MP3 format file.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Object.Sound = &quot;c:\mydirectory\mytune.mp3&quot;<br>
Object.State(&quot;Mouse down&quot;).Sound = &quot;ding.wav&quot;</p>
<h2>Object.Volume</h2>
<p>This allows you to set the volume of the sound played by an object. The range 
is 0 (muted) to 100 (full system volume)<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Object.Volume = 80<br>
Object.Volume = Object.Volume + 10</p>
<h2>Object.Picture<br>
also Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).Picture</h2>
<p>This allows you to get/set the picture of an object or state.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Object.Picture = “image01.png”<br>
Object.States(“Mouse away”).Picture = “C:\images\image01.png”<br>
Object.Picture = <a href="http://www.something.com/pic.png">
http://www.something.com/pic.png</a></p>
<p>Notes:<br>
- You can use the following modes:<br>
o File names: DX will check into the current theme or widget folder. Note that 
files must be registered as custom files or bound to at least one state for them 
to be packed into a .dxtheme, .dxpack or .exe.<br>
o Full path: this can be useful for totally dynamic things like a Picture viewer 
widget in that you can simply do:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnDropFiles(files)<br>
Object.picture = files<br>
End Sub</p>
<p>&#61607; Full path images are not exported.<br>
o Remote paths: you can use this to easily make a webcam object.<br>
&#61607; Remote path files are not exported.</p>
<h2>Object.SetPicture<br>
also Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).SetPicture</h2>
<p>This method let you set the picture of an object or state AND its other 
properties in one call.<br>
Syntax:</p>
<p class="code">Object.SetPicture fileName, frames, interval, flags<br>
For fileName see Object.Picture.<br>
Frames is the number of frames in the picture.<br>
Interval is the number of milliseconds between each frame.<br>
Flags is a combination of the following flags:<br>
&amp;H00000001 – Loop<br>
&amp;H00000002 – Reverse<br>
&amp;H00000004 – Alternate<br>
&amp;H00000008 – Interruptable<br>
&amp;H00000010 – Static</p>
<h2>Object.CurrentFrame</h2>
<p>Gets/sets the current frame of the animation. In order to use this, the 
animation should be set “Scripted” in the Properties panel.</p>
<h2>Object.Child</h2>
<p>Returns true if the object is a contained child. If it has a parent but it is 
only “owned” (Child = No in Summary page) , it will return false.<br>
Contained children coordinates are relative to the parent’s top/left corner.</p>
<h2>Object.SetMargins<br>
also Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).SetMargins</h2>
<p>This allows you to assign the image margins and tile/stretch settings of a 
state or all states of an object.<br>
Syntax:<br>
Object.SetMargins leftMargin, topMargin, rightMargin, bottomMargin, 
boolStretchX, boolStretchY</p>
<p>Values are distance from each edge. Set boolStretchX and boolStretchY to true 
to configure stretching mode. Leave false for tiling mode.</p>
<h2>Object.Command and Object.CommandParams</h2>
<p>Gets/sets the object command and parameters for Shortcut and URL object 
types.</p>
<h2>Object.Group</h2>
<p>Gets/sets the object group name.</p>
<h2>Object.RegisterHotkey and Object.UnregisterHotkey</h2>
<p>Let you register an hotkey combination. A special event is called when the 
user hits the hotkey.<br>
Syntax:<br>
Object.RegisterHotkey hotkeyID, hotkeyValue</p>
<p>hotkeyValue is defined as a long in the same way the HKM_GETHOTKEY returns (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/hotkey/messages/hkm_gethotkey.asp">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/<br/>platform/commctls/hotkey/messages/hkm_gethotkey.asp</a>):<br>
The virtual key code is in the low-order byte, and the modifier flags are in the 
high-order byte. The modifier flags can be a combination of the following 
values:</p>
<p>&amp;H00000001 - shift<br>
&amp;H00000002 - control<br>
&amp;H00000004 - alt<br>
&amp;H00000008 - extended key</p>
<p>Once the hotkey is set, the object script will be notified through:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnHotkey(id)</p>
<p>where id is the first parameter that is passed to RegisterHotkey.</p>
<p>To unregister the hotkey call:</p>
<p class="code">Object.UnregisterHotkey id</p>
<h2>Object.Comments</h2>
<p>Gets/sets the object comments field</p>
<h2>Object.SetFont<br>
also Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).SetFont</h2>
<p>Let you assign all font settings at once.<br>
Syntax:<br>
Object.SetFont fontName, size, boolBold, boolItalic, boolUnderline, 
boolStrikeOut, lfCharSet</p>
<p>You can leave the last parameter = 0</p>
<h2>Object.FontName, Object.FontSize, Object.FontBold, Object.FontItalic, 
Object.FontUnderline, Object.FontStrikeout<br>
also Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).FontName, Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).FontSize, 
Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).FontBold, Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).FontItalic, 
Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).FontUnderline, Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).FontStrikeout</h2>
<p>Let you get/set individual font options.</p>
<h2>Object.SetShadow<br>
also Object.States(&quot;name&quot;).SetShadow</h2>
<p>This allows you to assign the shadow options of a state or all states of an 
object.<br>
Syntax:<br>
Object.SetShadow boolEnabled, sharpness, darkness, offsetX, offsetY, sdwColor</p>
<p>Sharpness ranges from 0 to 100.<br>
Darkness can take values greater than 255.</p>
<h2>Object.SetScript(name)</h2>
<p>It let change script at runtime. This has a couple of rules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Path can be either relative to local path (CurrentTheme) or full path. 
	Files pointed to relative paths are automatically saved into 
	.dxpack/.desktop/.exe packages.</li>
	<li>ActiveX dynamic scripting is not yet supported.</li>
	<li>An object must be first configured as scripted and eventually have a 
	blank script if no real script is initially needed.</li>
	<li>The default script, edited from DesktopX GUI will not be used, if 
	overridden by an external script, unless the external script is &quot;unlinked&quot; 
	by calling Object.SetScript(&quot;&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Object.Cursor</h2>
<p>Let you get/set the current cursor.</p>
<p>0 = Normal select<br>
1 = Help select<br>
2 = Working in background<br>
3 = Busy<br>
4 = Precision select<br>
5 = Text select<br>
6 = Handwriting<br>
7 = Unavailable<br>
8 = Vertical resize<br>
9 = Horizontal resize<br>
10 = Diagonal resize 1 (NW-SE)<br>
11 = Diagonal resize 2 (NE-SW)<br>
12 = Move<br>
