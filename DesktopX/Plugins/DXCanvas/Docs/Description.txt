The DXCanvas plugin is a scripting plugin that exposes a canvas context to scripts (implementing the HTML 5 specification). It provides a drawing surface, that can be controlled from script.

It comes with a canvas controller widget, allowing you to quickly test your canvas scripts.

For more information, you can consult the HTML5 specification on the canvas: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-canvas
