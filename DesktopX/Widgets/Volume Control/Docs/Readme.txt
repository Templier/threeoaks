Volume Control Widget for DesktopX
 Copyright 2007-2008, Julien TEMPLIER aka Littleboy
--------------------------------------------------------

The Volume Control widget allows you to adjust the volume using your mouse wheel. 
 
Running this widget on XP has the following limitations:
 - volume and muting state are not really synchronized with the mixer dialog
 - disabling the 'Animate volume overlay' option will also disable
   the 'synchronisation' between the object and the master volume.
  
Original idea by ZubaZ and CerebroJD on #Stardock (irc.stardock.com)

********************************************************
** Installation
********************************************************

Because of a bug in DesktopX, you need to install the plugins manually before launching the widget.

Copy DXMouseWheel.dll and DXVolumeControl.dll to %ProgramFiles%/Stardock/Object Desktop/DesktopX/SDPlugins/

********************************************************
** Usage
********************************************************

Use the mousewheel to change volume. Middle click on the speaker to mute volume.

You can configure hotkeys for volume up/volume down/mute from the properties
dialog, as well as toggle the glow animation on or off.

Subject: Using your Speaker Image in a DesktopX widget
Hi Dwight,
 
I’m currently doing a volume control widget for DesktopX.
I would like to know if it’s okay if I use your speaker image
(http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/770110/) in it.
 
Best regards,
Julien
