The Volume Control widget allows you to adjust the volume using your mouse wheel.

- Support for master volume control in Vista
- Middle click for muting the volume
- Hotkey support for volume up/volume down/mute
- Volume overlay animated with the peak level 


Limitation on WindowsXP: Disabling the animation will also disable the 'synchronisation' between the widget and the volume mixer.

Vista only features: full synchronisation between the object and the volume mixer.

Note: Disabling the volume overlay animation on WindowsXP will also disable the 'synchronisation' between the object and the volume mixer.
