The .NET Runtime docklet allows you to use docklets built with .Net with ObjectDock.

This update brings the old .Net runtime to the 2.0 world along with support for Vista and UAC.

It includes 2 sample docklets (Birthday reminder and Featured skins) as well as the developer documentation.

You will need to have the .Net Framework 2.0 from Microsoft installed on you computer for this docklet to work. You can download it from here: http://www.microsoft.com/net/
