The .NET Interop docklet allows you to use .NET docklets with ObjectDock.

This runtime is needed to use docklets written with the .Net SDK for ObjectDock.

You will also need to have the .Net Framework from Microsoft installed on you computer for this docklet to work.

If you have an older version installed, you will need to quit ObjectDock before copying the new files.
