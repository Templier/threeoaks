 (c) 2004-2008 Julien TEMPLIER
---------------------------------------

The Featured Skins docklet allows you to see the latest featured skin for WindowBlinds
and IconPackager (SkinCast-like). You can add your own Featured Skins Providers (see
docklet.ini for more info).

The .Net Runtime for ObjectDock is required for this docklet to work.
