<h1>ActiveX Controls in DXScript</h1>
<p>The power of script is enhanced by the ability to display ActiveX controls on 
the desktop instead of using images or text. You can then manipulate these using 
scripts.<br>
For example, imagine an Excel spreadsheet, Windows Media Player, Combo box, Web 
Browser all embedded on your desktop. All are possible and very easy to create.<br>
In the DesktopX Script Editor, the first option on the script menu is 'ActiveX 
Control' from which there is a 'Select Control' option.<br>
We'll look at how to create one of these controls now.<br>
From the list that appears when you click 'Select Control', choose a control and 
then click OK. In our examples below we will use the 'Microsoft Web Browser' 
control.<br>
As you will see below, the Script Editor immediately changes to reflect your 
choice. On the right of the editor you will see a preview of the object, and 
below that you will see the properties of that object.<br>
<br>
Note that the ActiveX Control menu item now has a 'Properties' option where you 
can toggle to display of this extra information.<br>
If you close the editor via the close button top right or via 'File ... Exit' 
you will now see a control on your desktop.<br>
You will see that as you move your mouse over the object the cursor changes. You 
can move the control or resize it using the black handles at the edge.<br>
If you right click the object, you will notice a new item, 'Script Enabled' at 
the bottom of the list. This is the place where you can toggle the script 
between a 'running' and 'not running' state. At the moment it is not running 
which is why the resize handles are visible. Click 'Script Enabled' to toggle 
the running state and you will see these disappear.<br>
OK, so at the moment it's a dull white box, not very exciting, but nevertheless 
it's a control and we're about to ramp up the excitement. Let's go back to the 
editor.<br>
If you right click the control you will note that nothing happens. This is 
because you are effectively right clicking the Web Browser control, not a 
DesktopX object. Hold down CTRL so the resize edges appear and right click. You 
will see that the script is enabled because of the check mark next to that item. 
Click the Edit Script item and the dialogue will reappear.<br>
<br>
OK, try changing the script you see to the one below:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnScriptEnter<br>
Control.Navigate2 &quot;www.wincustomize.com&quot;<br>
End Sub</p>
<p>OK, so exit out of here and enabled the script. Caboom - all of a sudden you 
have a genuine webpage on your desktop!<br>
You will note from this that scripting is basically the same for Controls as it 
is for regular objects. The only real difference is that when referring to the 
ActiveX control you use the Control prefix. Note that you can also use Object 
methods and properties in the script but these refer to the host object. For 
example Object.Visible in an object containing an ActiveX control would hide 
that object and hence that control.<br>
<br>
Each ActiveX control will expose it's own properties and these are displayed in 
the autocomplete feature. This makes it really easy to start coding for a 
control.<br>
In addition to this it is useful to know which events are associated with a 
control. With this, we are able to react to events occurring in the control. 
DesktopX provides a tool to do just this. In the Script Editor, go to the Script 
Menu and select 'Event Wizard'.<br>
<br>
Select the event you want to add and click OK to add it to your script. Click 
'Done' when you have added all the events you want to.<br>
You can now add script to that event. For example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Control_DocumentComplete(pDisp, URL)<br>
Msgbox &quot;Finished downloading the page &quot; &amp; URL<br>
End Sub</p>
<p>Now, you will be advised when the page is completely loaded.<br>
<br>
One final thing you should know is that DesktopX installs three controls by 
default. There is an Edit control (to allow you to accept and react to user 
input), a Push Button control (which acts just like a regular button), and a 
Check Box control (to give you an on/off switch).<br>
Each of these controls have specific events and properties associated with them.</p>
