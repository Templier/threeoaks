<h1>Object callbacks</h1>
<p>These are events to which an object can respond. Script can be placed within 
these Subroutines and Functions to perform actions when these events occur.<br>
<br>
For functions, you should also return True or False at the end of the function 
as a clean coding practice. Returning True stops DesktopX processing additional 
events, which means that you can use functions like Object_OnRButtonDown to 
perform actions other that displaying the DesktopX right click menu (if 
enabled). You should return False otherwise.</p>
<h2>Object callbacks and scripts</h2>
<p>Starting 3.0 release, you don’t need a script just to respond to an Object 
callback. Child objects events will be automatically notified to the parent 
script, if one exists.<br>
It means you only need one script in the root parent object to get all events 
from its descendants, for instance Object_OnLButtonUp.<br>
To support this new style of coding and support pre-3.0 scripts at the same 
time, all callbacks described in this chapter, except for Object_OnScriptEnter 
and Object_OnScriptExit, also exist in *Ex form. *Ex callbacks have an 
additional first parameter of type Object.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
Standard callback:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnLButtonDown(x,y) ‘only called if the object has a 
script associated</p>
<p>Ex callback:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnLButtonDownEx(obj,x,y) ‘receives events from the 
object and all its children<br>
&nbsp; Select case obj.name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case “mybutton01”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘do something<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case “mybutton02”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘etc<br>
&nbsp; End Select<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnScriptEnter</h2>
<p>Occurs as soon as the script is enabled, which usually occurs when an object 
is loaded.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnScriptEnter<br>
Object.Text = Object.PersistStorage(&quot;mytext&quot;)<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnScriptExit</h2>
<p>Occurs as soon as the script is disabled, which usually occurs when an object 
is unloaded.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnScriptExit<br>
Object.PersistStorage(&quot;mytext&quot;) = Object.Text<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnStateChange(state), Sub Object_OnStateChanged(state)</h2>
<p>When the state of the object changes state these events are called and the 
variable (state) is identified allowing this one event to deal with all states.<br>
The differentiating factor is that OnStateChange is called as the change 
commences, and the OnStateChanged event occurs when the state change has 
completed. OnStateChanged is particularly useful for the synchronization of 
animated objects and effects.<br>
Note: Setting Object.StatePreempt inside Object_OnStateChange will actually have 
the special effect of switching the state being changed to the specified state. 
For instance you can hijack &quot;Mouse over&quot; messages to &quot;MyMover1&quot; and &quot;MyMover2&quot; 
depending on some state information.<br>
Note: You can usually more effectively use Object_OnMouseEnter and 
Object_OnMouseLeave notifications instead of checking for “Mouse over” and 
“Mouse away” states in Object_OnStateChange. It is more efficient because those 
events are direct and don’t rely on animation delays and queued animated states 
completitions.<br>
Note: Any references to states should be case sensitive.<br>
<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnStateChange(state)<br>
&nbsp; If state = &quot;Mouse over&quot; Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object.Opacity = 100<br>
&nbsp; ElseIf state = &quot;Mouse away&quot; Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object.Opacity = 50<br>
&nbsp; End If<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnMouseEnter, Sub Object_OnMouseLeave</h2>
<p>This is the cleaner way to check for user mouse interaction with an object. 
By using this you can avoid your code for these events being combined with other 
the state change code. You can use the OnMouseButton functions described later 
in combination with these very effectively.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnMouseEnter<br>
Object.Opacity = 100<br>
End Sub<br>
Sub Object_OnMouseLeave<br>
Object.Opacity = 50<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnShow(IsVisible)</h2>
<p>This function is triggered whenever the visibility of an object changes. A 
single variable is respond which is “True” or “False” depending on whether the 
object is being shown or hidden.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnShow(IsVisible)<br>
If IsVisible = True Then<br>
msgbox &quot;Showing object&quot;<br>
Else<br>
msgbox &quot;Hiding object&quot;<br>
End If<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnMove(x, y)</h2>
<p>This function is triggered whenever the position of an object changes, but it 
via mouse or keyboard movement, or by script manipulation. The coordinates of 
it’s new position are returned.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnMove(x,y)<br>
If x &lt; 100 Then Object.Left = 100<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnSize(width, height)</h2>
<p>If the objects size is adjusted then you can react to this event using this 
subroutine. In the following example the event ensures that the proportions of 
the object are constrained if the object gets resized.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnSize(width, height)<br>
Object.Height = Object.Width / 2<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnDropFiles (files)</h2>
<p>This event is triggered if the user drags one or more files onto the object 
and releases the mouse. A variable is returned containing the full path of all 
the files separates by a pipe (“|”) character.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Dim filelist<br>
Sub Object_OnDropFiles(files)<br>
filelist = Split(files,&quot;|&quot;)<br>
For x = 0 To UBound(filelist)<br>
outputmsg = outputmsg &amp; filelist(x) &amp; vbNewLine<br>
Next<br>
msgbox outputmsg<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnDrag(x, y, newX, newY)</h2>
<p>This event is fired as the object is dragged. The x and the y coordinates 
correspond the where on the object the click occurred and the “newPos” 
coordinated specify the top left position of the object in the position it has 
been dragged to.<br>
If the object’s position is locked then the x,y coordinated report a position 
relative to where the object was originally clicked.<br>
You can get the position of the object before it was dragged using Object.Left 
and Object.Top<br>
The example below allows you to drag an object to within 100 pixels of the 
primary monitor screen edge but no further.<br>
<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnDrag(x, y, newX, newY)<br>
If newX &lt; 100 Then Object.Left = 100<br>
If (newX + Object.Width) &gt; System.ScreenWidth - 100 Then<br>
Object.Right = System.ScreenWidth - 100 <br>
End If <br>
If newY &lt; 100 Then Object.Top = 100<br>
If (newY + Object.Width) &gt; System.ScreenHeight - 100 Then<br>
Object.Bottom = System.ScreenHeight - 100 <br>
End If <br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnDragFinish</h2>
<p>This event occurs when you finish dragging the object so you can react to the 
new position of the object. For example, the script below ensures that after an 
object has been moved then a second object is placed directly underneath it 
wherever it is placed.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnDragFinish<br>
DesktopX.Object(&quot;obj2&quot;).Top = Object.Bottom<br>
DesktopX.Object(&quot;obj2&quot;).Left = Object.Left<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Sub Object_OnSetFocus, Sub Object_OnKillFocus</h2>
<p>These events occur when an object receives or loses the focus. This means 
that you can react to a user starting to interact with or ending interaction 
with an object. You may just want to draw attention to the fact that the object 
has the focus of do something more like validate the input of a DesktopX Edit 
control if the user tries to leave it.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Object_OnSetFocus<br>
Object.state = &quot;FocusON&quot;<br>
End Sub<br>
<br>
Sub Object_OnKillFocus<br>
Object.state = &quot;FocusOFF&quot;<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Function Object_OnChar(key, extended)</h2>
<p>If an object has the focus then this function is called when a key is 
depressed and the ASCII character code is returned in the variable. Note that 
‘a’ and ‘A’ return different values so this event is well suited to responding 
to a user typing. It also returns a code to represent extended variables. These 
are not really necessary to interpret and can be ignored.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Function Object_OnChar(key, extended)<br>
Msgbox &quot;You pressed the &quot; &amp; Asc(key) &quot; key which has the ASCII value of &quot; &amp; key<br>
Object_OnChar = False<br>
End Sub</p>
<h2>Function Object_OnKeyDown(key, flags), Function Object_OnKeyUp(key, flags)</h2>
<p>This returns the actual key pressed rather than the ASCII value of the 
character returned. As such it is better suited to when you want to return the 
actual key such as an arrow key or Shift key. Note that in Edit mode certain 
keys such as the arrow key will move the object rather than respond to your 
code, but when in User mode as you should be whenever possible it will work 
fine.<br>
You can get a list of the valid key values here:<br>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/<br/>userinput/virtualkeycodes.asp<br>
You need to define the constant at the beginning of the script if you want to 
use a textual name for clarity.<br>
There is only really one useful extended value which will stop a character from 
repeating. This is shown in the second example.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Const VK_SHIFT = &amp;H10 'Shift Key<br>
Function Object_OnKeyDown(key, extended)<br>
If key = VK_SHIFT Then<br>
Msgbox &quot;Shift pressed&quot;<br>
End If<br>
Object_OnKeyDown = False<br>
End Function</p>
<p>The below example will move an object when it is selected and the enter key 
is pressed, but will not repeat the movement if the key is help; so the user 
must actively click the key again to do this.</p>
<p class="code">Const EnterKey = &amp;H0D<br>
Const Repeat = &amp;H40000000<br>
Function Object_OnKeyDown(key, flags)<br>
If key = EnterKey Then<br>
If Repeat &lt;&gt; (flags And Repeat) Then<br>
Object.Move Object.Left + 10, Object.Top<br>
End If<br>
End If<br>
End Function</p>
<h2>Function Object_OnLButtonDown(x, y), Function Object_OnRButtonDown(x, y), 
Function <br/>Object_OnLButtonUp(x, y, Dragged), Function Object_OnRButtonUp(x, y, 
Dragged)</h2>
<p>These functions are called as soon as the corresponding mouse button is 
pressed or released. In all cases two variables are returned which are the x and 
y coordinates within the object (i.e. not the screen position). In the ButtonUp 
functions, a third is returned True or False depending on whether the object has 
been dragged or not.<br>
Example:</p>
<p class="code">Function Object_OnLButtonDown(x, y)<br>
Object.PersistStorage(&quot;x&quot;) = Object.Left<br>
Object.PersistStorage(&quot;y&quot;) = Object.Top<br>
Object_OnLButtonDown = False<br>
End Function<br>
<br>
Function Object_OnLButtonUp(x, y, Dragged)<br>
If Dragged = True Then<br>
Msgbox &quot;You moved the object &quot; &amp; Object.Left - Object.PersistStorage(&quot;x&quot;) &amp; &quot; 
pixels horizontally and &quot; _<br>
&amp; Object.Top - Object.PersistStorage(&quot;y&quot;) &amp; &quot; pixels vertically&quot;<br>
End If<br>
Object_OnLButtonUp = False<br>
End Function<br>
