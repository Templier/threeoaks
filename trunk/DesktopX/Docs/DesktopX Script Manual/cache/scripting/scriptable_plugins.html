<h2>Scriptable E-Mail Notify plugin</h2>
<p>DesktopX 3.0 supports scriptable plugins that simply add some custom 
functionality. In the case of the Scriptable Mail Notify plugin, only the actual 
email check functionality is offered by the plugin, while the account 
management, the preferences, the configuration and everything else is left to 
the DesktopX author to be implemented with DesktopX objects and scripts.<br>
<br>
In order to use this plugin, you should add both a script and the “Scriptable 
Mail notify” plugin to an object.<br>
The plugin exposes only one method and one notification event.<br>
The method is:</p>
<p class="code">Mail.CheckMail requestID, sLogin, sPass, sServer, accountType</p>
<p>requestID is a string identifying the request. Since this method is 
asynchronous and returns immediately, if you are handling multiple accounts you 
need to match responses with requests. This value let you do that, since you get 
back the same identifier when the response is ready.<br>
sLogin is the mail account user name, sPass is the password, sSever is the 
server name (i.e. “mail.stardock.com”).<br>
AccountType can be 0 for POP3 or 1 for IMAP.<br>
<br>
Use the event wizard to get the following event added to the script:</p>
<p class="code">Sub Mail_OnMailEvent(requestID, newMails)</p>
<p>This event will be fired when a request has been accomplished. RequestID 
contains the identifier passed in the request and newMails is a number 
indicating the unread mails.<br>
