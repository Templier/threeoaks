The Volume Control widget allows you to adjust the volume using your mouse wheel.


- Support for master volume control in Vista
- Middle click for muting the volume
- Hotkey support for volume up/volume down/mute
- Volume overlay animated with the peak level 

INSTALLATION:
Because of a bug in DesktopX, you may need to install the plugins manually before launching the Gadget. Copy DXMouseWheel.dll and DXVolumeControl.dll to %ProgramFiles%/Stardock/Object Desktop/DesktopX/SDPlugins/

Changelog:

Version 1.1:
 - Updated DXMouseWheel and DXVistaVolume plugins
 - Exported as a standalone gadget
 
Version 1.2:
 - Added option to adjust volume increments/decrements (now defaults to 3%)


Limitation on WindowsXP: Disabling the animation will also disable the 'synchronisation' between the widget and the volume mixer.
