This is an animated dreidel widget.

It comes with two animations (with or without shadow), but you can also use your own art with it. 

See DreidelConfig.ini.example for more information. There is included support for AlexG Dreidel animation: http://www.wincustomize.com/skins.aspx?skinid=1456&libid=3
If you're interested in adding new animations and would like more flexibility, please contact me!
